# JsonParser

## NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE

This extension to `JToken` allows you to deserialize to objects without default constructors and with `get`-only properties. It handles primitive types, complex objects, arrays and lists.

Examples are found in the test project.

Copy and paste the content of `Parser.cs` and adjust it to fit your .NET version.
